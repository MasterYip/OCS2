O\+C\+S2 is a C++ toolbox tailored for Optimal Control for Switched Systems (O\+C\+S2). The toolbox provides an efficient implementation of the following algorith


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+LQ\+: Continuous-\/time domin D\+DP
\item i\+L\+QR\+: Discrete-\/time domain D\+DP
\item S\+QP\+: Multiple-\/shooting algorithm based on H\+P\+I\+PM
\item P\+I\+S\+OC\+: Path integral stochatic optimal control
\end{DoxyItemize}



O\+C\+S2 handles general path constraints through Augmented Lagrangian or relaxed barrier methods. To facilitate the application of O\+C\+S2 in robotic tasks, it provides the user with additional tools to set up the system dynamics (such as kinematic or dynamic models) and cost/constraints (such as self-\/collision avoidance and end-\/effector tracking) from a U\+R\+DF model. The library also provides an automatic differentiation tool to calculate derivatives of the system dynamics, constraints, and cost. To facilitate its deployment on robotic platforms, the O\+C\+S2 provides tools for R\+OS interfaces. The toolboxâ€™s efficient and numerically stable implementations in conjunction with its user-\/friendly interface have paved the way for employing it on numerous robotic applications with limited onboard computation power.
